## Task 1:

As a result of each point, you should provide a corresponding command.

localhost - your CentOS VM running in VirtualBox

remotehost - 18.221.144.175 (public IP)

webserver - 172.31.45.237 (private IP)

#### 1.1. SSH to remotehost using username and password provided to you in Slack. Log out from remotehost.
```
ssh Rustam_Mukhomedishin@18.221.144.175
exit
```

#### 1.2. Generate new SSH key-pair on your localhost with name "hw-5" (keys should be created in ~/.ssh folder).
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
path: /home/rustam2/.ssh/hw-6
```

#### 1.3. Set up key-based authentication, so that you can SSH to  remotehost  without password.
```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/hw-6 Rustam_Mukhomedishin@18.221.144.175
```

#### 1.4. SSH to remotehost without password. Log out from remotehost.
```
ssh Rustam_Mukhomedishin@18.221.144.175
exit
```
I coldn't login without password. Permissions on files and directories are correct. I couldn't detect a problem yet.

#### 1.5. Create SSH config file, so that you can SSH to remotehost simply running `ssh remotehost` command. As a result, provide output of command `cat ~/.ssh/config`.
```
Host remotehost
  HostName 18.221.144.175
  User Rustam_Mukhomedishin
```

#### 1.6. Using command line utility (curl or telnet) verify that there are some webserver running on port 80 of webserver.  Notice that webserver has a private network IP, so you can access it only from the same network (when you are on remotehost that runs in the same private network). Log out from remotehost.
```
ssh remotehost
curl -v http://172.31.45.237:80
exit

Never Gonna Give You Up :D
```

#### 1.7. Using SSH setup port forwarding, so that you can reach  webserver from your localhost (choose any free local port you like).
```
ssh -L 2022:172.31.45.237:80 remotehost
```
I couldn't open the web-page on localhost:2022. Is my command corrected?

#### 1.8 Like in 1.6, but on localhost using command line utility verify that localhost and port you have specified act like webserver, returning same result as in 1.6.
```
curl -v http://localhost:2022
```
It doesn't work :(
What's wrong?

1.9 (*) Open webserver webpage in browser of your Host machine of VirtualBox
(Windows, or Mac, or whatever else you use). You may need to setup port forwarding
in settings of VirtualBox.

## Task 2:
Following tasks should be executed on your localhost as you will need root privileges
#### 2.1. Imagine your localhost has been relocated to Havana. Change the time zone on the localhost to Havana and verify the time zone has been changed properly (may be multiple commands).
```
sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/Havana | timedatectl
```

#### 2.2. Find all systemd journal messages on localhost, that were recorded in the last 50 minutes and originate from a system service started with user id 81 (single command).
```
journalctl --since '-50min' _UID=81 -u *.service
```

#### 2.3. Configure  rsyslogd  by adding a rule to the newly created configuration file /etc/rsyslog.d/auth-errors.conf to log all security and authentication messages with the priority alert and higher to the  /var/log/auth-errors file. Test the newly added log directive with the logger command (multiple commands)
```

```
I didn't deal with log rules yet. I'm coming back to it.
